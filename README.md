(Detailed code explanations are included in the comments)

1. [**CharacterAction.cs**](https://github.com/Gavin-Guiii/The_Little_Match_Girl_AR/blob/main/CharacterAction.cs) <br>It works like a timeline and lets non-playable characters to perform certain actions at desired moments.



2. [**LightMatch.cs**](https://github.com/Gavin-Guiii/The_Little_Match_Girl_AR/blob/main/LightMatch.cs) <br> It handles all the functions related to match lighting.



3. [**DetectClickableObject.cs**](https://github.com/Gavin-Guiii/The_Little_Match_Girl_AR/blob/main/DetectClickableObject.cs) <br> It determines whether a virtual object is a [**ClickableObject**](https://github.com/Gavin-Guiii/The_Little_Match_Girl_AR/blob/main/ClickableObject.cs) or a [**SequentialClickableObject**](https://github.com/Gavin-Guiii/The_Little_Match_Girl_AR/blob/main/SequentialClickableObject.cs). If so, it will invoke corresponding events.
